`storyboard` is a customizable video storyboard generator with metadata reporting directly embedded in the generated images, based on [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/). Reported metadata fields include, but are not limited to, title, filename, file size, SHA-1 digest, container format, duration, pixel dimension, display aspect ratio (DAR), scan type (progressive, interlaced, or telecined), frame rate, and per-stream metadata (type, codec, profile, dimensions, bitrate, etc.). See the samples below to get a feel for `storyboard`'s capabilities.

## Sample storyboards

## Background

`storyboard` was inspired by the storyboards I frequently see on video-sharing Internet forums, mostly generated by proprietary video players. Those storyboards come with video/file metadata bundled, which is a great all-in-one solution for video sharing, saving one the labor of typing multiple console commands, copying and pasting output, and worrying about the forum's crappy formatting. However, I, for one, dislike proprietary players. Also, those storyboards are usually ugly and uninformative, using stupid fonts and lacking crucial information that hackers look for (e.g., hash). Therefore, here I present a customizable storyboard generator for hackers.

## Dependencies

* [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), specifically `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`. Homebrew users can install FFmpeg with

    ```
brew install ffmpeg
```

    Be sure to review the list of options in `brew info ffmpeg` first. `storyboard` should not depend on any of the options to function, but FFmpeg is a great tool in its own right (several orders of magnitude greater than `storyboard`), so you might want to link against optional libraries to your own benefit.

    Unfortunately, `avconv` and `avprobe` have incompatible interfaces with their FFmpeg counterparts, so there is no plan to support Libav (see [#16](https://github.com/zmwangx/storyboard/issues/16) for details). Fortunately, FFmpeg is making its come back to Ubuntu in [15.04 vivid](http://packages.ubuntu.com/vivid/ffmpeg), after several years of unfair treatment.

* [Pillow](https://python-pillow.github.io/). Python wheels of Pillow are provided for OS X and Windows on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/), so it is usually enough to simply

    ```
pip install Pillow
```

    However, it is recommended that you also satisfy the external dependencies, especially `libjpeg` and `libfreetype`, on OS X and Linux. See [the official installation guide](https://pillow.readthedocs.org/installation.html) for details.

## Installation

```
pip install storyboard
```

Make sure you satisfy the FFmpeg dependency and external library dependencies of Pillow, e.g., `libjpeg` and `libfreetype`.

Note that prereleases need to be installed with the `--pre` option, so be sure to try `pip install --pre storyboard` if the above fails.

## Command-line usage

The package installs two console scripts, `metadata` and `storyboard`. Usage of both scripts can be found using the `-h,--help` option. **Note that CLIs are currently extremely primitive.** To generate customized storyboards, one needs to write one's own wrapper around the API (which is well-documented in the source code). I plan to improve the CLI in future releases and expose more features.

### `metadata`

`metadata` prints video metadata in a human-readable format, e.g. (for [this video](http://podcasts.apple.com/apple_keynotes_1080p/2015/2015_mar_1080_cc.m4v)),

```
Filename:               2015_mar_1080_cc.m4v
File size:              6083965352 (5.67GiB)
Container format:       MPEG-4 Part 14 (M4V)
Duration:               01:34:45.27
Pixel dimensions:       1920x1080
Display aspect ratio:   16:9
Scan type:              Progressive scan
Frame rate:             29.97 fps
Streams:
    #0: Audio (eng), AAC (Low-Complexity), 99 kb/s
    #1: Video, H.264 (Main Profile level 4.1), 1920x1080 (DAR 16:9), 29.97 fps, 8453 kb/s
    #2: Subtitle (eng), closed caption (EIA-608 / CEA-708)
```

which is a good alternative to `ffprobe`'s basic functionality. Compare this to the mess that `ffprobe -hide_banner` prints (see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/zmwangx/ee8986c2f0596f1ebbb0)).

### `storyboard`

Currently, `storyboard` prints the path of the generated image to the console, which by default resides in one's `$TMPDIR`. One can then move it to a permanent place, or upload it to a image hosting site.

## Reporting issues

Please report issues or browse a list of known issues at <https://github.com/zmwangx/storyboard/issues>. See "Known issues" for instructions on how to report issues related to an unknown codec.

## Known issues

* Windows support is planned and already tested to some extent, but testing is limited since unlike OS X, Windows is not my primary platform. Please report any issue in the issue tracker — that's very much appreciated.

* `storyboard` uses `PIL.ImageFont` from Pillow to draw text, which is rather primitive and only allows one font at a time (no fallback). The default font packaged is Source Code Pro Regular, which only draws its supported code points, and leave unknown code points as boxes. In particular, there is no CJK support, so CJK characters in video filenames won't come out very nice.

    You can specify your own font file that covers (part of) CJK code points, but the catch is that you should really use fixed-width fonts (unless you want to blow up the beautiful formatting, in which case you might as well use a proprietary player to generate a storyboard that's bad-looking inside out). It's basically impossible to have a truly fixed-width font that mixes CJK glyphs with Latin glyths, since they are so different — CJK glyphs are intrinsically square-shaped. This is just a sad fact of life and there's nothing we can do about it. Therefore, **there's no CJK support in `storyboard`** (CJK characters won't break `storyboard` — they just come out as boxes). Hopefully you're using ASCII filenames anyway; if you're not, you really should.

* `metadata.py` treats each codec separately, and the list of supported codecs is far from complete. If you encounter an audio/video/subtitle codec that triggers stupid output, please report an issue or open a pull request. **If it's not a commonly seen codec, please link to a sample video with the relevant codec (cut it short with FFmpeg if possible) so that I can inspect and test.**

* `ffprobe` might report the wrong duration for certain VOB or other videos, which screws up the whole thing. See [#3](https://github.com/zmwangx/storyboard/issues/3). As a fallback, you can use the optional parameter `video_duration` to `storyboard.storyboard.StoryBoard` or `storyboard.metadata.Video` (see source files for extensive API doc).
